This is a simple Reddit copy made with Laravel.
Itâ€™s for my portfolio and has basic features for users to explore, post, and join communities.

How to run (paste to terminal):

git clone https://github.com/xoni178/bluedit

composer install

npm install

copy .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate

php artisan migrate

php artisan db:seed

php artisan serve //start laravel server on http://127.0.0.1:8000

(paste to different terminal): npm run dev //start vite server
